# Banking-System
Our project was made in mind with the goal of simulating an online banking experience as much as possible. Including several features that many real-life banks employ. Among these include: Account Registering, Sign-in Verification, Withdrawal and Deposit services, Loan Applications, a Savings account, and an interactive Main Menu
Run from the Bank or Launch Application classes.
